# Angular Webpack 2 Boilerplate

## Purpose

This was originally part of [an ES6 training](bit.ly/es6-intro-slides) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)

Now I refactored it in correspondence with lessons from [egghead.io](http://egghead.io/)


## Thanks

This codebase was originally taken from the ES6 TodoMVC training by [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds) project starting [here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/es6-todomvc). Big thanks to him for the awesome lessons!

## Project Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run validate`

This includes Angular with Angular-UI-Router and has one main page

## Notes

Because Webpack 2 is currently in beta, there are issues with `peerDependencies`, so youâ€™ll have to use npm version 3 to be able to install the dependencies.
